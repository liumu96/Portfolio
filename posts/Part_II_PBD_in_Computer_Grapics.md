## Part 2: The Core of PBD

In this section, we will

- present the basic idea and the simulation algorithm of PBD
- discuss **how** to solve the system of constraints that are described to be simulated  
  The simulated objects:
- a set of $N$ particles
- a set of $M$ constraints
- a stiffness parameter $k \in [0, 1]$: the strength of the constraint

## ðŸŒŸÂ Time Algorithm

**Algorithm 1** Position-based dynamics: Given this data and a time step $\Delta t$  
1: **for all** vertices $i$ **do**  
2: &ensp;&ensp;initialise $\bold x_i = \bold x_i^0, \bold v_i = \bold v_i^0, w_i = 1 / m_i$  
3: **end for**  
4: **loop**  
5: &ensp;&ensp;**for all** vertices $i$ **do** $\bold v_i \leftarrow \bold v_i + \Delta t w_i \bold f_{ext}(\bold x_i)$  
6: &ensp;&ensp;$dampVelocities(\bold v_1, â€¦, \bold v_N)$  
7: &ensp;&ensp;**for all** vertices $i$ **do** $\bold p_i \leftarrow \bold x_i + \Delta t \bold v_i$  
8: &ensp;&ensp;**for all** vertices $i$ **do** $genCollConstraints(\bold x_i \rightarrow \bold p_i)$  
9: &ensp;&ensp;**loop** solverIteration **times**  
10: &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;$projectConstraints(C_1, â€¦, C_{M + M_{coll}}, \bold p_1, â€¦, \bold p_N)$  
11: &ensp;&ensp;**end loop**  
12: &ensp;&ensp;**for all** vertices $i$ **do**  
13: &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;$\bold v_i \leftarrow (\bold p_i - \bold x_i) / \Delta t$  
14: &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;$\bold x_i \leftarrow \bold p_i$  
15: &ensp;&ensp;**end for**  
16: &ensp;&ensp;$velocityUpdate(\bold v_1, â€¦, \bold v_N)$  
17: **end loop**

(1) - (3) specify the positions and the velocities of the particles  
(5) - (7) perform a simple **symplectic Euler integration** step on the velocities and positions, the new locations $\bold p_i$ are used as predictions  
(8) generate non-permanent **external constraints**, such as collision constraints  
(9) - (11) iteratively corrects the predicted positions such that they satisfy the $M_{coll}$ external as well as the $M$ internal constraints  
(12) - (15) Use the corrected positions $\bold p_i$ to update the velocities and positions

## ðŸŒŸÂ Solver

The system **problem**: a set of $M$ equations for the $3N$ unknown position components, where $M$ is the total number of constraints.  
Solving a **non-symmetric, non-linear** system with **equalities** and **inequalities** is a tough problem.  
Let $\bold x$ be the concatenation $\bold x = [\bold x_1^T, â€¦, \bold x_N^T]^T$,

$$
C_1(\bold x) \succ 0 \\
... \\
C_M(\bold x) \succ 0
$$

where the symbol $\succ$ denotes either $=$ or $\geq$.  
**`The Newton-Raphson iteration`** is a method to solve **`non-linear` symmetric systems with equalities** only. It starts with a first guess of a solution. Each constraint function is then **`linearized`** in the neighborhood of the current solution using

$$
C(\bold x + \Delta \bold x) = C(\bold x) + \nabla C(\bold x) \cdot \Delta \bold x + O(|\Delta \bold x|^2) = 0
$$

This yields a linear system for the global correction vector $\Delta \bold x$

$$
\nabla C_1(\bold x)\cdot \Delta \bold x = - C_1(\bold x) \\
... \\
\nabla C_M(\bold x)\cdot \Delta \bold x = - C_M(\bold x)
$$

where $\nabla C_j(\bold x)$ is the $1\times N$ dimensional vector containing the derivatives of the function $C_j$ w.r.t. all its parameters, i.e. the $N$ components of $\bold x$. Both, the rows $\nabla C_j(\bold x)$ and the right-hand side scalars $-C_j(\bold x)$ are constant as they are evaluated at the location $\bold x$ before the system is solved.

When $M=3N$ and only equalities are present, the system can be solved by any linear solver, e.g., a preconditioned conjugate gradient method.

**`Non-linear Gauss-Seidel Solver`** : it solves each constraint equation $C(\bold x) \succ 0$ separately

Given $\bold x$ , we want to find a correction $\Delta \bold x$ such that $C(\bold x + \Delta x) \succ 0$. The constraint equation is approximated by

$$
\begin{align}C(\bold x + \Delta \bold x) \approx C(\bold x) + \nabla C(\bold x) \cdot \Delta \bold x \succ 0\end{align}
$$

Based on the linear and angular momentum conservation requirements, $\Delta \bold x$ is restricted in the direction of $\nabla C$ .

With a scalar Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ :

$$
\begin{align}\Delta \bold x = \lambda \bold M^{-1} \nabla C(\bold x)\end{align}
$$

where $\bold M = diag(m_1, m_2, â€¦, m_N)$ and $w_i = 1 / m_i$. The correction vector of a single particle $i$

$$
\begin{align}\Delta \bold x_i = \lambda w_i \nabla_{\bold x_i} C(\bold x)\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}\lambda = \frac{C(\bold x)}{\sum_j w_j|\nabla _{\bold x_j}C(\bold x)|^2}\end{align}
$$

Formulated for the concatenated vector $\bold x$ of all positions, we get:

$$
\begin{align}\lambda = \frac{C(\bold x)}{\nabla C(\bold x)^T\bold M^{-1}\nabla C(\bold x)}\end{align}
$$

The Gauss-Seidel method

- stable and easy to implement
- converges significantly slower than global solvers. The main reason is that error corrections are propagated only locally from constraint to constraint.

**Hierarchical Solver: increase the convergence rate of the Gauss-Seidel method**

![Figure 2: The construction of a mesh hierarchy: A fine level l is composed of all the particles shown and the dashed constraints. The next coarser level, l + 1, contains the proper subset of black particles and the solid constraints. Each fine white particle needs to be connected to at least k (=2) black particles â€“ its parents â€“ shown by the arrows.](/papers/hierarchy-meshes.png)

Figure 2: The construction of a mesh hierarchy: A fine level l is composed of all the particles shown and the dashed constraints. The next coarser level, l + 1, contains the proper subset of black particles and the solid constraints. Each fine white particle needs to be connected to at least k (=2) black particles â€“ its parents â€“ shown by the arrows.

The main idea is to **create a hierarchy of meshes** in which the coarse meshes make sure that error corrections propagate fast across the domain.

Hierarchical Position-Based Dynamics (HPBD):

- define the original simulation mesh to be the finest mesh of the hierarchy
- create coarser meshes by only keeping a subset of the particles of the previous mesh.
- The hierarchy is traversed only **once** from the coarsest to the finest level. Therefore, they only need to define a **prolongation** operator.

âœ¨Â **Connection to Implicit Methods**

By considering backward Euler as **a constrained minimization over positions**. Starting from the traditional implicit Euler time discretization of the equations of motion

$$
\begin{align}
\bold x^{n+1} &= \bold x^n + \Delta t \bold v^{n+1} \\
\bold v^{n+1} &= \bold v^n + \Delta t \bold M^{-1}(\bold F_{ext} + k\nabla \bold C^{n+1})
\end{align}
$$

where $\bold C$ is the vector of constraint potentials; $k$ is the stiffness. We can eliminate velocity to give:

$$
\begin{align}
\bold M(\bold x^{n+1} - 2\bold x^n + \bold x^{n+1} - \Delta t^2 \bold M^{-1}\bold F_{ext}) = \Delta t^2 k \nabla \bold C^{n+1}
\end{align}
$$

Equation (12) can be seen as **the first-order optimality condition for the following minimization**:

$$
\begin{align}
\underset{\bold x}{min} \frac{1}{2}(\bold x^{n+1} - \tilde {\bold x})^T\bold M(\bold x^{n+1} - \tilde {\bold x}) - \Delta t^2 k \bold C^{n+1}
\end{align}
$$

where $\tilde {\bold x}$ is the predicted position, given by:

$$
\begin{align}
\tilde {\bold x} &= 2\bold x^n - \bold x^{n-1} + \Delta t^2 \bold M^{-1}\bold F_{ext} \\
&= \bold x^n + \Delta t \bold v^n + \Delta t^2 \bold M^{-1} \bold F_{ext}
\end{align}
$$

Taking the limit as $k \rightarrow \infty$ we obtain the constrained minimization:

$$
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\underset{\bold x}{min} \frac{1}{2}(\bold x^{n+1} - \tilde {\bold x})^T\bold M(\bold x^{n+1} - \tilde {\bold x}) \\
s.t. C_i(\bold x^{n+1}) = 0, i = 1, ..., n.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
$$

We can interpret this minimization problem as **finding the closest point on the constraint manifold to the predicted position**.

To solve this minimization, PBD employs a variant of the fast projection algorithm but modifies the projection step by linearizing constraints one at a time using a Gauss-Seidel approach.

âœ¨Â **Second Order Methods**

the second-order accurate BDF update equations

$$
\begin{align}
\bold x^{n+1} &= \frac{4}{3}\bold x^n - \frac{1}{3}\bold x^{n-1} + \frac{2}{3} \Delta t\bold v^{n+1} \\
\bold v^{n+1} &= \frac{4}{3}\bold v^n - \frac{1}{3}\bold v^{n-1} + \frac{2}{3} \Delta t\bold M^{-1}(\bold F_{ext} + k\nabla \bold C^{n+1})
\end{align}
$$

Eliminating velocity and re-arranging gives

$$
\begin{align}
\bold M(\bold x^{n+1} - \tilde {\bold x}) = \frac{4}{9}\Delta t^2 k \nabla \bold C^{n+1}
\end{align}
$$

where the inertial position $\tilde {\bold x}$ is given by:

$$
\begin{align}
\tilde {\bold x} &= \frac{4}{3}\bold x^n - \frac{1}{3}\bold x^{n-1} + \frac{8}{9}\Delta t \bold v^n - \frac{2}{9} \Delta t\bold v^{n-1} +\frac{4}{9}\Delta t^2 \bold M^{-1} \bold F_{ext}
\end{align}
$$

Equation (19) can again be considered as the optimality condition for a minimization of the same form as (16).

Once the constraints have been solved, the updated velocity is obtained according to (17)

$$
\begin{align}
\bold v^{n+1} = \frac{1}{\Delta t}\left [ \frac{3}{2}\bold x^{n+1} - 2\bold x^n + \frac{1}{2}\bold x^{n-1} \right]
\end{align}
$$
